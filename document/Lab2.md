# Lab2: Performance Analysis

In this lab, you will learn how to analysis network performance.

### Task 1: Run uniform random traffic and other traffic patterns (shuffle, transpose, tornado, neighbor) at increasing injection rates (e.g. 0.01 -> 0.5) through a 8x8 Mesh NoC for 10000 CYCLEs, and plot the latency-throughput curve. Analyze the result (lower low-load latency, throughput, hop-count, etc.).

### Task 2: Change other parameters(vcs-per-vnet, router-latency, link-width-bits), plot the latency-throughput curves, and analyze result.

### Task 3: Answer the questions.

- What are the components of network latency? Which component is dominant/bottleneck (for different traffic patterns/loads/linkwidths).
- What is the depth of input buffer and the default flow-control?

## Submit: A Report

- Should contain the results of the tasks (plot and analysis for task 1 and 2; answer for task 3)
